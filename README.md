## "Space Blast" Arcade Style Game

The story takes place in space where the soldier (player's character) flew too far away from his home planet and found himself stranded somewhere in the Asteroid Belt.
The player has to help the soldier maneuver his spaceship through the dense field of asteroids in order to get to his home planet (which is infinitely far away at this point).
Upon crashing into an asteroid, player gets a chance to live if they defeat all enemies inhabiting the asteroid. This will allow the player to steal their spacecraft and continue the journey.
While flying in the spacecraft players need to collect different claimable items which will prepare them for the challenges that lie ahead.
